#A regular expression that matches a version number in the raw HTML returned by a page
#A good starting place is:
#(?<=PREFIX)[0-9]+(?:[\.\-][0-9]+)*[ \-\(]{0,7}(?:beta|alpha|rc[0-9]*){0,1}[)]{0,1}(?=.*POSTFIX)
# where PREFIX is some string that version numbers are preceded by (Ex: "firefox-") and POSTFIX
# is a string that follows the version number

#Dependencies must be specified here (These should only be programs that
#are required in order for the package to run. For example LibreOffice
#requires that the Oracle JRE be installed in order for it to work
#In this case the JDK or JRE will work so the dependencies would be a list of lists
#and would look like: [["JDK", "JRE"]]. This means that the JDK and JRE are interchangable as
#a dependency.

#Recommended programs should be specified here. A recommended program is one
#That is not required but helps it preform better. For example, CamStudio works better
